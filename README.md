# Ddrupal7 to Ddrupal7 Migration

Once upon a time, in the dusty archives of the [Blind Help Project](https://BlindHelp.net), we had an 8.5-year-old Drupal 7 site—burdened with broken tables, orphaned entries, and just about every legacy issue you can imagine. It was a wonderful mess! Instead of leaving it to its tangled fate, we decided to give it a fresh start, purging the unnecessary bits and bringing over only what still mattered. 

**D7toD7Migration** is the result: a custom module that successfully migrates nodes, terms, users, and paragraph items with their relationships and references intact, preserving the history and essence of the old site while moving it into a brand-new Drupal 7 setup.

## Dependencies
Because some jobs are just too big to do alone, this module depends on:
- [Migrate Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate)
- [Migrate D2D Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_d2d)
- [Paragraphs Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs)

Together, they form the backbone of our migration toolkit, handling much of the heavy lifting and ensuring smooth, reliable transfers.

## Features
This module carefully migrates:
- **Nodes** to their respective content types, preserving structure and integrity.
- **Taxonomy Terms** into their vocabularies, with relationships to nodes intact.
- **Users** with full authorship associations, so the original voices stay linked to their content.
- **Paragraph Items** along with all their references, bringing over even the most nested content without breaking a sweat.

## Our Migration Journey
Taking on this project was no small feat. The site was a classic example of "legacy gone wrong," but we knew it deserved a second chance. With D7toD7Migration, we tackled the challenge, reassembling content relationships like an elaborate puzzle—nodes with their terms, users with their authored content, and paragraphs with their precious references. We learned, we debugged, we even questioned our sanity a few times, but in the end, it was all worth it.

## Why Share This?
We're making this module public because we know we aren’t the only ones with a Drupal 7 legacy site teetering on the brink. If you, too, have an ancient Drupal 7 project with similar migration needs, or just want to see a real-life example of a D7-to-D7 migration, feel free to dive in, adapt, or even have a laugh along the way.
